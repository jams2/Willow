====================
Willow image library
====================

Willow is a pure Python library that aims to unite many Python imaging libraries
under a single interface.

Out of the box, Willow can work with Pillow, Wand or OpenCV. None of these image
libraries are required (but you should have either Pillow or Wand installed to
use most features). It also has a plugin interface which allows you to add
support for more libraries, image formats and operations.

Willow supports processing of SVG images without any additional libraries.
Format conversion to or from SVG is not currently supported.
